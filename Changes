  - Fixed the blacklist of bad versions of libxml2.  It is based
    on the list of versions rejected by XML-LibXML.
  - As with XML-LibXML, you can force Alien-Libxml2 to install by
    setting the environment variable FORCE to a true value.

  - Look for libxml2 in some standard places.
    OS X, for example provides a libxml2, but (unhelpfully) does not
    provide the .pc file to go along with it.
  - Do not accept same bad versions refused by XML::LibXML
    on share install
